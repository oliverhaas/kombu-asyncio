class ConsumerMixin:
    """Convenience mixin for implementing async consumer programs.

    Pure asyncio implementation.

    The basic class would need a :attr:`connection` attribute
    which must be a :class:`~kombu.Connection` instance,
    and define a :meth:`get_consumers` method that returns a list
    of :class:`kombu.Consumer` instances to use.

    Example:
        class Worker(ConsumerMixin):
            task_queue = Queue('tasks', Exchange('tasks'), 'tasks')

            def __init__(self, connection):
                self.connection = connection

            def get_consumers(self, Consumer, channel):
                return [Consumer(queues=[self.task_queue],
                                 callbacks=[self.on_task])]

            async def on_task(self, body, message):
                print(f'Got task: {body!r}')
                await message.ack()

        # Run the worker:
        async with Connection('redis://localhost') as conn:
            worker = Worker(conn)
            await worker.run()

    Methods:
        * extra_context(connection, channel)

            Optional extra async context manager that will be entered
            after the connection and consumers have been set up.
            Takes arguments (connection, channel).

        * on_connection_error(exc, interval)

            Handler called if the connection is lost or unavailable.
            Takes arguments (exc, interval), where interval is the time
            in seconds when the connection will be retried.
            The default handler will log the exception.

        * on_connection_revived()

            Handler called as soon as the connection is re-established
            after connection failure. Takes no arguments.

        * on_consume_ready(connection, channel, consumers)

            Handler called when the consumer is ready to accept messages.
            Takes arguments (connection, channel, consumers).

        * on_consume_end(connection, channel)

            Handler called after the consumers are canceled.
            Takes arguments (connection, channel).

        * on_iteration()

            Handler called for every iteration while draining events.
            Takes no arguments.

        * on_decode_error(message, exc)

            Handler called if a consumer was unable to decode
            the body of a message. Takes arguments (message, exc).
